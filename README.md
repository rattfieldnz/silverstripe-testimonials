# SilverStripe Testimonials

Modified version of the testimonial management and display for a SilverStripe website.

**Note** This is based on the module forked by [i-lateral](https://github.com/i-lateral/silverstripe-testimonials), who in turn forked the module from [burnbright](https://github.com/burnbright/silverstripe-testimonials). The latter fork is said to be 'abandoned'.

## Features

 * Creation of testimonlials that can contain: Content, Name, Business, Date, Show and Image
 * Testimonials holder page that lists Testimonials.
 * Testimonlials widget that can show a random testimonial in the widget area.
 
## Newly added in this fork 

 * Adding list of comma-delimited authors, who are not registered as part of the Silverstripe CMS.
