# SilverStripe Testimonials

Modified version of the testimonial management and display for a SilverStripe website.

**Note** This is based on the module originally created by [Burnbright](https://github.com/burnbright/silverstripe-testimonials)
that appears to have been abandond.

## Features

 * Creation of testimonials that can contain: Content, Name, Business, Date, Show and Image
 * Testimonials holder page that lists Testimonials.
 * **NEW (version 4.0.0)** - You can now add Youtube videos to testimonials (thanks to the good work of the [YouTube Field for SilverStripe](https://github.com/silverstripe-terraformers/silverstripe-youtubefield) package, by [silverstripe-terraformers](https://github.com/silverstripe-terraformers)).
